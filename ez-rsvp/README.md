# EZ-RSVP

## An RSVP Site for Event Management
	
### Description: 
An RSVP site where users can set up their own events (e.g. weddings, baby showers), 
list the event details (e.g. date/time, venue), and share their event link with others. 
Users who go to the event link can see all the details and submit an RSVP form with their name and email address.

### Problem to be Solved:
Organizing events such as weddings, baby showers, and birthday parties can be quite challenging. 
Often, people forget to RSVP or lose the invitation, leading to confusion about who will attend the event. 
Our proposed RSVP site solves this problem by providing a centralized platform where event organizers can 
easily set up their events, share the details with attendees, and receive RSVPs without any hassle.

### Potential Users:
The potential users of our RSVP site include event organizers and attendees. Event organizers can 
create events, share the details with their guests, and manage RSVPs. Attendees can view the event details and submit their RSVPs.

### User Interaction and Input:
Event Organizer: The event organizer will need to create an account and log in. Then, they will create 
a new event by providing the event details such as the date, time, venue, and event description. 
After the event is created, they can share the event link with their guests. The organizer will also be 
able to view and manage the list of attendees who have submitted their RSVPs.

### Attendee: 
The attendee will receive the event link from the event organizer and will click on it to view the 
event details. They will then submit their RSVP by providing their name and email address. 
After submitting the RSVP, they will receive an email confirming their submission. 

### (Bonus): 
Guests will receive an email and must click on the link in the email in order to actually RSVP. 
This would prevent spamming event organizers by entering several random names/emails.
